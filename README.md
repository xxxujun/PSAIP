# PSAIP: Prior Structure-Assisted Identity-Preserving Network for Face Animation

### Installation

We support ```python3```.(Recommended version is Python 3.9).
To install the dependencies run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### YAML configs
 
There are several configuration files one for each `dataset` in the `config` folder named as ```config/dataset_name.yaml```. 

See description of the parameters in the ```config/taichi-256.yaml```.

### Datasets

 **VoxCeleb**. Follow instructions from [video-preprocessing](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/video-preprocessing). 


### Training
To train a model on specific dataset run:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python run.py --config config/dataset_name.yaml --device_ids 0,1
```
A log folder named after the timestamp will be created. Checkpoints, loss values, reconstruction results will be saved to this folder.



### Evaluation on video reconstruction

To evaluate the reconstruction performance run:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python run.py --mode reconstruction --config config/dataset_name.yaml --checkpoint '{checkpoint_folder}/checkpoint.pth.tar'
```
The `reconstruction` subfolder will be created in `{checkpoint_folder}`.
The generated video will be stored to this folder, also generated videos will be stored in ```png``` subfolder in loss-less '.png' format for evaluation.
To compute metrics, follow instructions from [pose-evaluation](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/pose-evaluation).


### Image animation demo
- notebook: `demo.ipynb`, edit the config cell and run for image animation.
- python:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python demo.py --config config/vox-256.yaml --checkpoint checkpoints/vox.pth.tar --source_image ./source.jpg --driving_video ./driving.mp4
```
